    "  R is a free and open-source, specialized programming language designed for statistical analysis. The latest version of R, as of this writing, is R 3.5.1 and its download for Windows is available [here](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/). Previously released versions of R for Windows can also be found at this [location](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/old/). The bridge supports all versions of R from version 3.2.2 on to the latest release. \n",
    "  \n",
    "  Additionally, the R-ArcGIS bridge can be used with all three versions of Microsoft R, Microsoft R Open, Microsoft R Client, and Microsoft R Server. More information on these offerings can be found on [Microsoft's website for the project](https://mran.microsoft.com/documents/rro/multithread). The process for installing and working with the bridge in Microsoft's R offerings is no different than the process for traditional R. To start this process, simply download the latest version of Microsoft R you wish to work with. Microsoft R Open is free and open-source and can be downloaded [here](https://mran.microsoft.com/open). \n",

    "  Once R (and optionally [RStudio](#Get-RStudio)) is installed, proceed to [Check ArcMap or ArcGIS Pro Software Version](#Step-2:-Check-ArcMap-or-ArcGIS-Pro-Software-Version) to ensure you have the appropriate ArcGIS desktop software to work with the bridge.\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Installing R Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "   By default, R will install to your `C:\\Program Files` directory and it will install both a 32-bit and a 64-bit version. Unless you have an advanced use-case or plan to work exclusively in ArcMap or ArcGIS Pro, these defaults should be accepted as is. If you select to modify the installation location of R, make note of your choice as this information will be needed when installing the R-ArcGIS bridge. Additionally, should you select to only install one version of R (either 32-bit or 64-bit), be aware this will limit your options for working with the bridge. For more information, see the section on [additional version details](#Additional-Version-Details). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Get RStudio\n",
    "  \n",
    "  RStudio is a popular interactive development environment (IDE) for R that can simplify working with the language and has several nice features. It has multiple versions available for download, including a free version, which can be found [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). While most commonly used with RStudio, R can also be used in other popular IDEs like Visual Studio, IntelliJ (via plug-in), and Jupyter Notebook. \n",

    "  The R-ArcGIS bridge provides support for ArcMap, version 10.3.1 and beyond, and for ArcGIS Pro, version 1.1 and beyond. If you meet these requirements, you have everything you need to work with the bridge and can proceed to [installing the R-ArcGIS bridge](#Step-3:-Install-the-R-ArcGIS-bridge). \n",

    "### Additional Version Details\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ArcGIS Pro is a 64-bit application and therefore, will work with the 64-bit version of R. ArcMap on the other hand, is a 32-bit application and will work with the 32-bit version of R, unless you install Background Geoprocessing and enable it to run scripts in the background. In which case, you can work with the 64-bit version of R however, in this set-up, you can only use the bridge from ArcGIS and not from within R itself. For more details on working in 64-bit in ArcMap, proceed to [ArcMap and Background Geoprocessing](#ArcMap-and-Background-Geoprocessing). Additional details on switching R between its 32-bit and 64-bit version will be covered in [the select your R version section](#Select-Your-R-Version). \n",

Full documentation on Background Geoprocessing can be found [here](http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/analyze/executing-tools/64bit-background.htm). Once you have installed Background Geoprocessing, you will need to enable it in ArcMap by navigating to your Geoprocessing Options under the Geoprocessing tab. This allows scripts to run in the background and full details on this setting can be found [here](http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/analyze/executing-tools/foreground-and-background-processing.htm). \n",

While functionality of the R-ArcGIS bridge is consistent between ArcMap and ArcGIS Pro, in versions of Pro 2.0 and beyond, an installer for the bridge has been included. This simplifies the process of setting up the R-ArcGIS bridge and makes checking for new versions of the bridge easy. If you wish to try working in ArcGIS Pro, this is a good place to start. If you are uncertain of how to access your version of ArcGIS Pro, a free 21-day trial version can be found [here](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-pro/trial). \n",

You can use this option to switch between different versions as needed. To do so, start by doing the following:\n",
    "   * Open RStudio and check the current version by looking at the automatically printed messages in the console window. You will see both your R Version number and whether you are currently in 32-bit R or 64-bit R.\n",
